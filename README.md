# What is KoDialogue?
KoDialogue is a node based text adventure game engine that allows you to create your own adventures by making use of nodes. KoDialogue support two types of nodes, choices and fake choices:  
Choices are nodes that lead you to another dialogue node and act as ramifications in the game engine.  
Fake chocies are a collections of node that lead you to a single dialogue node. They allow you to give the player a sense of choice while maintaining the scope of your game manageable.  
# Why KoDialogue?  
KoDialogue aims to simplify the dialogue tree model down to its basics so the user can focus on writing the adventure. KoDialogue is also designed to be hackable and for the user to experiment with its code as they like.
